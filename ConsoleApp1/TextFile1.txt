SOLID

S: Single Responsiblity principle.
Sachin wife took care of all other matters And sachin was only focussed on cricket.
UserController should only have methods relatred to users specific. Not role and other related,
Example Member class can have method of CreateMemebership,Remove memebership defintely not removeuser()
or makebooking() it shouold be in boiking class not member class.


O: Open for extension closed for modfication.It means you class cannot be modified but it can'
be extended.
L: Lisckovs Substitution Principle.

A is divided into B C D. Any method on A should be implemented on B C D. 
And actual implementation sould be there . 

I: INterface Segrettaion principle:
Any Client should not be forced to implemnt interface which is irrelevant to it.
Example When you go to restaurent you have deifferent menu for Drink and food. 
Dont provide menu for non drinkers with drink menu and men for food to people who comes to drink/
Dont force client to implment interface which is irrelevant to it.
Lets say we have booking class.It has 2 method bookingdetails and paymentdetails.
We create IPayment INterface with a method SavePaymentDetails.

D: Dependency Invesrion Principle
Move the Dependency out of the classes.
